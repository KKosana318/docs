## Overview

Fix AI automates frontend QA testing using AI agents that navigate through websites to execute user flows and check for bugs.

Fix AI is a platform where you can create, edit, and run frontend QA tests. Tests are defined by **user flows**, which are individual journeys users may take to complete a task on your website, such as "create an account", "purchase a product", etc.

To use Fix AI, you first create a flow. That flow can then be run on a set schedule or ad-hoc. Each time a flow is run, a detailed replay of the run, with videos of each step being executed along with any bugs that are caught, are visible in the dashboard.

## Creating Flows

With Fix AI, an individual flow consists of a series of interactions that are performed on a website. These steps are defined in natural language. For instance, to test a sign in flow, you might define the following steps:

<Steps>
    1. Navigate to sign in page 2. Click the email input field 3. Type in "fixaibot@gmail.com" 4. Click the password input field 5. Type in "password"
    6. Click the sign in button 7. Verify that the user is signed in and the internal dashboard is visible
</Steps>

<Note>
    Currently, we provide white-glove onboarding, where we'll build and manage your tests for you. For this reason, the flows page is **not yet
    available** by default. For customers who'd like a self-serve experience, we can potentially give you access to the flows page on request.
</Note>

## Running Flows

Flows are typically run on a set schedule. Flows can also be individually run via the Fix AI dashboard. When a flow is run, a browser is setup and our agent attempts to execute each step on your website. A video of each step being executed is recorded, and any bugs that are caught are also reported.

After a run completes, it can be viewed on the run replay page.

## Bug Reporting

Each time a flow is run, all bugs are reported and captured both on the run replay and on a separate bugs page.

Bugs can be sent directly via Slack or Linear

## Onboarding Process

We are currently in a private beta and provide custom onboarding for each customer. Here's what to expect:

<Steps>
    1. **Flow Planning** - We work with you to create a list of all user flows that need to be tested, typically over Slack or a quick call. 2. **Flow
    Creation** - We'll build all your flows for you. This process typically takes 1-3 days. 3. **Scheduling Runs** - We'll schedule your flows to run
    at your preferred cadence. 4. **Ongoing Support** - When new flows are needed or existing flows need changes, we can make those changes for you on
    an ad-hoc basis. Our turnaround time is typically less than a day.
</Steps>

## Communication and Support

Each customer gets access to a dedicated Slack channel where you can:

-   Receive updates as we build and manage your flows
-   Get notified of any bugs that arise from runs
-   Request edits or creation of new flows
-   Ask questions and get quick assistance
